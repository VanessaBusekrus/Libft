# Libft - The very first library

Libft is a project that involves rewriting a set of functions from the standard C library (libc) with the same prototypes and behaviors as the original functions. The only difference is that the functions will have names prefixed with 'ft_' instead of the standard names. This project aims to help you understand the underlying implementation of these functions and provide a library that can be used in other projects.

## Part 1 - Standard C Library Functions

The following functions are implemented in the Libft library:

### String Manipulation
- `ft_strlen`: Calculate the length of a string.
- `ft_strchr`: Locate the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- `ft_strrchr`: Locate the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- `ft_strlcpy`: Copy strings with a size limit.
- `ft_strlcat`: Concatenate strings with a size limit.
- `ft_strnstr`: Locate a substring within a string.
- `ft_strjoin`: Concatenate two strings.
- `ft_strtrim`: Trim characters from the beginning and end of a string.
- `ft_substr`: Create a substring from a string.

### Character Classification
- `ft_isalpha`: Check if a character is alphabetic.
- `ft_isdigit`: Check if a character is a digit.
- `ft_isalnum`: Check if a character is alphanumeric.
- `ft_isascii`: Check if a character is a valid ASCII character.
- `ft_isprint`: Check if a character is printable.
- `ft_toupper`: Convert a character to uppercase.
- `ft_tolower`: Convert a character to lowercase.

### Memory Manipulation
- `ft_memset`: Fill memory with a constant byte.
- `ft_bzero`: Set a block of memory to zero.
- `ft_memcpy`: Copy memory from one location to another.
- `ft_memmove`: Copy memory from one location to another, handling overlaps.
- `ft_memchr`: Locate the first occurrence of a byte in memory.
- `ft_memcmp`: Compare two memory areas.
- `ft_calloc`: Allocate and clear memory for an array.
- `ft_strdup`: Duplicate a string.

### String Conversion
- `ft_atoi`: Convert a string to an integer.

## Part 2 - Additional Functions

In this part, you will find additional functions not found in the standard C library, including:

- `ft_itoa`: Convert an integer to a string.
- `ft_strmapi`: Apply a function to each character in a string and create a new string.
- `ft_striteri`: Apply a function to each character in a string with the character's index.
- `ft_putchar_fd`: Output a character to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putstr_fd`: Output a string to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putendl_fd`: Output a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putnbr_fd`: Output an integer to a file descriptor.

These functions are not only useful for your Libft library but can also be used in various other projects.

## Bonus Part - List Manipulation Functions

If you completed the mandatory part, you can further enhance your library with these bonus functions to manipulate lists. These functions can be very useful in various projects that involve linked lists.

### List Structure

To work with lists, you will need to use the following structure in your code. Please add its declaration to your `libft.h` file:

```
typedef struct s_list
{
    void *content;
    struct s_list *next;
} t_list;
```

The t_list structure contains two members:

content: The data contained in the node. It is a void *, allowing you to store any kind of data.
next: The address of the next node in the list, or NULL if the current node is the last one.
Bonus Functions
In your Makefile, add a "bonus" rule to compile and include the bonus functions in your libft.a library. The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is perfect, meaning it has been fully implemented and works without any issues.

### Bonus functions:

- `ft_lstnew`: Allocates and returns a new node for the list.
- `ft_lstadd_front`: Adds a node at the beginning of the list.
- `ft_lstsize`: Counts the number of nodes in a list.
- `ft_lstlast`: Returns the last node of the list.
- `ft_lstadd_back`: Adds a node at the end of the list.
- `ft_lstdelone`: Deletes and frees the memory of a node and its content.
- `ft_lstclear`: Deletes and frees all nodes in the list and sets the pointer to NULL.
- `ft_lstiter`: Iterates through the list and applies a function to the content of each node.
- `ft_lstmap`: Iterates through the list, applies a function to the content of each node, and creates a new list.
